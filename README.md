üß† How It Works
Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization
Removing stop words
Lemmatization or Stemming
Vectorization using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer
Model Training:

Train machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM on the processed data.
Sentiment Prediction:

Predict sentiment labels for new reviews using the trained model.
Visualization:

Plot sentiment distributions and word clouds for deeper insights.
üõ†Ô∏è Usage
1. Preprocessing Data
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:

bash
Copy code
python src/preprocess.py
2. Training the Model
Train the sentiment analysis model:

bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py
3. Making Predictions
Predict the sentiment of new reviews:

bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py --review "The food was amazing and the service was excellent!"
4. Visualizing Results
Generate visualizations of sentiment distribution:

bash
Copy code
python src/visualize.py
üñ•Ô∏è Run the Flask API for Live Predictions
Start the Flask API:
